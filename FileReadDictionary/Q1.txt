In order to create a complete a BST, we will first insert all the word with their meanings in the array. We will start with the middle element of the array as the root node of the tree. It will be of the form 

rootElement = array.length * 1 / 2
leftNode = array.length * 1 / 4
rightNode = array.length * 3/4

and from the left node, we will calculate the same calculations and so on.
